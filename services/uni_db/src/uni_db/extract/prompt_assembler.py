"""Prompt assembler.

Plan §F.3 / Audit §5.2. Composes:

  glossary header  +  field-group system message  +  archetype-specific
  few-shot examples  +  user template (with the actual source slice)  +
  strict JSON envelope reminder.

Tests pass synthetic Korean text through the assembler and assert the
final envelope (a) is well-formed, (b) embeds the required tokens
(authoritative glossary terms, schema reminders, source span markers),
and (c) is stable enough that prompt regressions are caught in code
review via `extract.prompts.snapshots`.
