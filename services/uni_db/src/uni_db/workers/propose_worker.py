"""Propose-sources worker — auto-discover unknown ac.kr admission boards.

`run-pipeline` and `reparse` only ever touch sources we already track. To grow
coverage to universities we've never crawled, this runs the Naver web-search
adapter over the Korean keyword vocabulary, maps each surviving hit to a
`propose_source.Candidate`, and writes it to `proposed_sources` for the HITL
reviewer to approve (ADR-005). Approved rows are promoted into
`announcement_sources` by the `trg_proposed_source_promote` trigger — nothing
goes live without a human, so this worker is safe to schedule.

The Naver HTTP call lives in `NaverSearchAdapter`, which self-gates on
`settings.live_apis`; this module only orchestrates the keyword loop, the
cross-keyword url dedup, and the gate-and-insert via `propose_batch`. Both the
per-keyword search and the propose sink are injectable so the loop unit-tests
without live HTTP or a database.
