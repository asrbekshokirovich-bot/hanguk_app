"""Per-source PDF download resolvers.

The parse pipeline starts from an `announcements` row whose `attachments`
array nominally contains a PDF URL. For most boards (KAIST, eGov HTML
boards) that URL is a direct PDF stream — the orchestrator can `httpx.get`
it and move on. For others (Korea University, Yonsei) the recorded URL
points at an HTML detail page that *contains* the real download link
(behind a JS click handler or a query-string-keyed download endpoint).

A resolver bridges that gap: given a detail-page URL + an httpx client,
it returns a `ResolvedPdf` describing the real PDF URL, the suggested
filename, and any extra request headers required (e.g. a Referer).

Adding a new resolver:
    1. Drop a new module in this package (e.g. `inha.py`) that exposes a
       `resolve(attachment_url, *, http_client, referer=None) -> ResolvedPdf | None`
       coroutine.
    2. Register it in `_REGISTRY` below keyed by the lowercase URL host
       (or a tuple of hosts) where the detail page lives.
    3. Add a unit test under `tests/unit/test_pdf_resolvers.py` covering
       happy-path, no-link fallback, and shape assertions, with a real
       detail-page fixture under `tests/fixtures/<source>_detail.html`.

Resolvers must be side-effect free beyond the single HTTP GET they make
to fetch the detail page, must never block on Playwright/headless
browsers when a static endpoint exists, and must return ``None`` when
the detail page does not contain a recognisable PDF link (the caller
falls back to the legacy direct-fetch path).
